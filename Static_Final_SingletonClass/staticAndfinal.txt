==> static-keyword:
-->Shared memory allocation
-->Accessible without object instantiation
-->Associated with class, not objects
-->Cannot access non-static members
-->Can be overloaded, but not overridden
-->only 

==> final-keyword:
-->Final variables: 
1)When a variable is declared as final, its value cannot be changed once it has been
initialized. This is useful for declaring constants or other values that should not
be modified
2)final variable name should be in capital letter
-->Final methods: 
When a method is declared as final, it cannot be overridden by a subclass. This is 
useful for methods that are part of a classâ€™s public API and should not be modified
by subclasses
-->Final classes: 
When a class is declared as final, it cannot be extended by a subclass. This is 
useful for classes that are intended to be used as is and should not be modified 
or extended
-->Initialization: 
Final variables must be initialized either at the time of declaration or in the 
constructor of the class. This ensures that the value of the variable is set and
cannot be changed
-->Performance: 
The use of final can sometimes improve performance, as the compiler can optimize 
the code more effectively when it knows that a variable or method cannot be changed
-->Security: 
final can help improve security by preventing malicious code from modifying 
sensitive data or behavior
